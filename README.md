# Select-Copy-Chord-Levels *Plugin for MuseScore 4.x*
 A MuseScore 4.x plugin that extends and copies selection to notes with the similar chord-level(s) and/or voices over a selected range.  

 ## Usage
 - Select a note at a chord level(s) you wish to filter/select/copy.

 - Select an end note to which you want the selection extended.
 
 - If no end note is selected then, the selection will be extended to cover the current measure. 

 - Running the plugin twice consecutively will extend the selection to the whole staff.

 - The plugin supports multiple selections across multiple staves and voices simultaneously. 

 - However, if the selected notes are not in adjacent staves, the plugin will only filter/select, but not copy (limitation from Musescore not allowing copying non adjacent staves).

 ## Download and install
 You only need to download "Select-Copy-Chord-Levels.qml" and put it in your MuseScore plugin folder.
