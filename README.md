# Select-Copy-Chord-Levels
 MuseScore Plugin 

 Select a note at a chord level(s) you wish to filter/select/copy.

 Select an end note to which you want the selection extended.
 
 If no end note is selected then, the selection will be extended to cover the current measure. 

 Running the plugin twice consecutively will extend the selection to the whole staff.

 The plugin supports multiple selections across multiple staves and voices simultaneously. 

 However, if the selected notes are not in adjacent staves, the plugin will only filter/select, but not copy (limitation from Musescore not allowing copying non adjacent staves).

 Please feel free to send any suggestions, bug reports, or just let me know if you find the plugin helpful  :)
